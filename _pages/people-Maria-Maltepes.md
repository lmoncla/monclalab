## Bio 

After graduating from Temple University ('21) with a B.S in Data Science, I found myself fascinated by the ability to navigate complex biological systems using bioinformatics. This fascination ultimately motivated me to join the Biology PhD program at Penn in 2022.

I am mainly interested in uncovering the evolutionary history of viral populations and understanding their transmission dynamics between and within hosts. Currently, I am working on elucidating the evolution of H3 influenza viruses, a project inspired by the canine influenza outbreaks here in Philadelphia. I am curious to see if there are signatures of adaptive evolution within different H3 virus lineages, and if their adaptive rates vary by host.

Outside of lab, I love binging trash reality shows and watching Oscar nominated films, going to concerts, exploring different cities, eating lots of vegetarian food, and hanging out with my niece!
