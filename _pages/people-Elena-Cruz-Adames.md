## Bio 

I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Biology from University of Pennsylvania in 2022. During this time, my love for birds led me to the [Schmidt lab](https://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/marc-schmidt) where I studied neural circuits underlying courtship behavior in brown-headed cowbirds. This was where I developed my interest in animal behavior, which ultimately led me to Ecuador. Here I was able to help conduct field research studying the effect of gut passage by manakins on the germination success of tropical fruiting plants. Broadly, I am interested in wildlife preservation, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Now, I am excited to join the Moncla Lab to learn more about virus transmission and evolution within given animal populations.

Outside of the lab, I really enjoy going for walks with my dog, biking along the river, and reading a good book. And recently I have been working on honing my cross-stitching skills.
