## Bio 

I completed my PhD in 2023 at the University of Minnesota in the [Aliota Lab](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/aliota-laboratory/home) where I studied arbovirus emergence, pathogenesis, and evolution. During my graduate studies in vector-borne viruses (amid a global viral pandemic), I became particularly interested in understanding how ecological and anthropogenic factors (urbanization, climate change, agricultural practices, etc.) impact how viruses emerge, evolve, and transmit. As a postdoctoral researcher in the Moncla lab, I am excited to expand on these interests and skills by utilizing more computational approaches to understand avian influenza transmission and evolution.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy walking my dog, trying out new vegetarian recipes, and keeping up with too much reality competition TV.
