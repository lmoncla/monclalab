### August 28, 2023: The lab goes to the CEIRR Network Meeting 
Jordan, Lambo, and I went to the [CEIRR](https://www.ceirr-network.org/) Annual Network meeting this year in Baltimore, MD. Lambo gave a poster on some work from his PhD using generalized additive models to model seasonal influenza circulation and transmission patterns, and Jordan got to meet some new people and hear about a lot of cool research! I did a demo of the [avian flu Nextstrain builds](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5nx/ha) for the [Computational Modeling Core](https://www.ceirrcmc.org/) showcase, and gave a talk on our work using new structured coalescent models to study H5Nx cross-species transmission. It was really fun to see old friends and meet some new people as well. 


### August 25, 2023
Today we celebrated all of the lab's summer successes and said goodbye to Alex, who is off to start a new job at AstraZeneca. This summer, both Jordan and Maria joined the lab as PhD students, and Lambo won a [Verena Fellowship](https://www.viralemergence.org/fellows) to work with Barbara Han on modeling canine influenza. To celebrate these successes and Alex's time in the lab, we went out in West Philly and finally took a lab photo!

### June 14, 2023
The summer is off to a good start! I taught for a day in Fort Collins, CO for the [Genomics of Disease in Wildlife Workshop](https://gdwworkshop.colostate.edu/). I lectured and lead two lab activities about phylodynamics, BEAST, and Nextstrain. The participants and co-instructors were awesome, and Fort Collins was beautiful. All the course materials (lectures and lab activities) are publicly available on the [course github page](https://github.com/gdw-workshop/2023_GDW_Workshop), as well as on my github page [here](https://github.com/lmoncla/csu-genomics-disease-wildlife-workshop). Here are some pictures from the workshop hike!

### February 14, 2023: A Bird Flu Pandemic Hovering on the Horizon? 
__[A Bird Flu Pandemic Hovering on the Horizon](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/podcasts/naked-scientists-podcast/bird-flu-pandemic-hovering-horizon)__<br/>
I did an interview for the Naked Scientist (a BBC podcast series) on the ongoing avian influenza outbreak in North America, why it's distinct from past outbreaks, and what we should be thinking about going forward. Also featured in this are some of my all-time favorite virologists (Wendy Barclay!), giving great commentary.


### November 30, 2022: What is bird flu and how deadly is it? 
__[What is bird flu and how deadly is it?](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63464065)__<br/>
I provided a quote for Helen Briggs, who was writing an article about the ongoing avian influenza outbreak for BBC News. The article discusses why this outbreak is distinct from past outbreaks, and possible reasons why this one is so widespread. 


### October 21, 2022: Why is bird flu so bad right now?

Saima Sidik from Nature News chatted with me about the ongoing H5N1 avian influenza outbreak that is happening in the US and Europe, which is causing devastating impacts on wild and domestic birds. We talked about why this outbreak is different from past outbreaks, and what we still need to learn about H5N1 going forward. 


### July 29, 2022: A podcast with TWiEVO!
__[TWiEVO 80: Viruses of a feather bottleneck together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcHmebKO_K4)__<br/>
I had a great time doing this podcast with Vincent Racaniello and Nels Elde for their podcast This Week in Evolution ([TWiEVO](https://www.microbe.tv/twievo/)). We talked about our work looking at H5N1 cross-species transmission, SARS-CoV-2 within-host diversity, and mumps transmission in  Washington State, and swapped notes on the excellent ASV (American Society for Virology) meeting in July 2022 in Madison, WI.
