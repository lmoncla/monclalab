## Bio 

I am broadly interested in how ecological, human behavioral, and societal processes shape the ecological-evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases, and how to design effective interventions accordingly.

During my PhD in Bryan Grenfell’s lab at Princeton University, I addressed fundamental questions, such as disease ecology of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a natural bird population, how wild bird movements influence evolutionary and spatial dynamics of avian influenza, how population immunity and strain competition affect vaccine effectiveness for human influenza. 

At Moncla lab, I’m excited to further my research in avian influenza transmission and evolution, blending viral phylogeny and epidemiological models. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, a warm cup of tea, a good movie, good food, hanging out with friends, organizing/volunteering.
