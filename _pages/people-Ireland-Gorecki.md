## Bio 

I am an undergraduate student in the College of Arts and Sciences at Penn pursuing a major in Biology and concentrating in Mechanisms of Disease. I am interested in genomic mapping and viral transmission, as it particularly relates to legislative decisions in public health and policy. Starting in the Moncla Lab, I have been able to identify differentiating factors between urban and rural census tracts and blocks, with the hopes of categorizing Sars-Cov-2 strains into their respective geographic locations.

Before coming to Penn, I researched socioeconomic data at the University of Georgia in the Department of Sociology. There, I analyzed the correlation between anthropogenic indicators and Human Trafficking trends in Georgian counties to eventually spread awareness to teens in highly susceptible areas. I drafted task force proposals for state and local legislators and shadowed various officers in North Atlanta task force groups.

Outside of lab, I spend a lot time exploring Philadelphia, participating on the Quaker Girls Dance Team, and baking with my sorority sisters!
