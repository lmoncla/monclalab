# Data and resources 

We are intersted in work that lies at the intersection of basic science and public health. We also believe in open science, and are excited by public, interactive data displays. We strive to make our data and code public, and to create tools and visualizations that are useful for academic, public health labs, and interested people from the public. 


## Nextstrain links:

We are heavily involved in [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/), and built and maintain the avian influenza resources there. Check out global phylogenies for [H5Nx](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5nx/ha), [H5N1](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5n1/ha), [H7N9](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h7n9/ha), and [H9N2](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h9n2/ha) avian influenza viruses. We update these builds ever month. 

If you have avian influenza data that you would like to analyze using Nextstrain resources, check out our tutorial and example data [here](https://github.com/lmoncla/csu-genomics-disease-wildlife-workshop/tree/main/nextstrain-lab). 

## Moncla lab Nextstrain builds 
In addition to the resources hosted on the live Nextstrain site, we also maintain custom or work in progress phylogenies for other projects on our [Moncla lab Nextstrain Group page](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab). Check out some of our other fun builds there: 

1. [North American analysis of the ongoing H5Nx outbreak in 2022](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha)

2. [Long-term evolution of H3Nx influenza viruses](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h3nx/ha)


### Data and code availability: 
All of our code for ongoing projects can be found on our lab [github page](https://github.com/moncla-lab). We will be keeping scripts and protocols documented there. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
