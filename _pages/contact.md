Thanks for your interest in the lab! We are located in Hill Pavilion, on Penn's main campus in Philadelphia. If you are interested in joining the lab, please send me an email with the following: 

__Graduate students:__<br/> 
*If you are not yeet in graduate school:* We take graduate students through the established graduate programs at the University of Pennsylvania. If you are interested in the lab, I encourage you to apply to one of the Penn graduate programs, and contact me about doing a rotation after you've been accepted. We are affiliated with the (Microbiology, Virology, and Parasitology Program)[https://www.med.upenn.edu/camb/mvp.html], and the (Genomics and Computational Biology Program)[https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/]. If you've been accepted into a different, related, graduate program at U Penn and would like to chat about rotating, feel free to reach out. **We are unable to take direct admit students at this time.** <br/>

*If you are accepted to a U Penn graduate program, or are already at U Penn:* Please write me an email letting me know which graduate program you are in, a bit about your background, and when you are hoping to rotate. Please attach a CV or resume, and let me know why you're interested in the lab!

__Post-docs:__ Tell me a bit about what your PhD work was about, what it showed/contributed to the field, and why you are interested in the lab. Please also include a CV and names of 2 references, as well as your approximate timeline for finishing your PhD/starting in the group. 

__Undergraduates:__ Please let me know your major, year, and why you are interested in the group!
